# Pharos
Named after the Lighthouse of Alexandria, **Pharos** is a browser application designed to provide an alternative interface for installing ports and wine-arm64 wrappers. Pharos follows GitHub repository links listed in a configurable file `.sources` and presents ports hosted on those repositories.

## How It Works

1. Pharos reads a list of repository URLs from plaintext file `.sources`.
2. It parses each repository and displays ports in its GUI.
4. Downloaded files are placed in `Pharos/autoinstall`.
5. Pharos installs the port or wine bottle to either `roms/ports` or `roms/windows` folders.
6. Pharos updates `gamelist.xml` with `gameinfo.xml` included with the download.

> **Important:** For Pharos to parse and display repositories correctly, participating repositories must follow a **compatible file structure** and have a valid `ports.json` or `winecask.json` file.

## Security
Pharos does **not perform validation** on downloaded files. Users are responsible for ensuring that all sources are trusted and safe.

## Hosting Your Own Repository
To host a repository compatible with Pharos, ensure it adheres to the expected structure and `ports.json` or `winecask.json` format. For guidance, see the [template repository](https://github.com/JeodC/Pharos-Template).

## Thanks
Pharos is a python application inspired by RomM and PortMaster. Some code is based on existing functions from those applications, hence the AGPL license.
